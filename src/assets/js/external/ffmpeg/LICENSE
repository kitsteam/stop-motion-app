It is currently necessary to include and self-host several of the FFMmpeg.wasm files. 

See this issue:
https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm/issues/548

and the documentation (See INFO) for more details:
https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/installation
https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/docs/faq#what-is-the-license-of-ffmpegwasm

Therefore, we include the files in this repository to serve them ourselves. The License for the FFMpeg.wasm files can be found here:
https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme

FFmpeg.wasm uses libraries from the FFmpeg project under the LGPLv2.1. We do not own FFmpeg. See https://ffmpeg.org
